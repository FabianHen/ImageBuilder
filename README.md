# ImageBuilder
This program builds an image out of other images. Don't know what that's supposed to mean?

## Here is an example

<code> py ImageBuilder.py D:\Projects\ImageBuilder\example.jpg 200 </code><br>
<em>(Note that the "Stock" folder from this example is no part of this repository) </em><br>
### Input Image:

### Output Image 
![Output Image](example_result.jpg)
